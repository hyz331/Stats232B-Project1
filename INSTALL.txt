                                 SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT

Although RGM (it stands for Reconfigurable Grammar Model) is wriiten for cross-plathform use, 
it is developed under Ubuntu 14.04 at the current stage because it is very easy to set up the 
developing environment. We will test RGM for Windows OS and Mac OS in the future. 



                                 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

In general, the code here is developed with the help from voc-release 5 
by Dr. Ross Girshick and Prof. Felzenszwalb.
The code for computing HOG features, FFT convolution and LBFGS is adapted 
from FFLD by Dr. Charles Dubout <http://charles.dubout.ch/en/coding.html>. 
We are grateful to them for make their codes publicly available.


                                 
                                 PREREQUISITES

RGM requires that various libraries be available for use in the build procedure.
  (* In Ubuntu 14.04, all the prerequisites can be installed using "Ubuntu Software Center"
     and then you do not worry about compile them, except for the latest version of OpenCV.)

Install all dependencies with CommandLine
  sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libboost1.55-all-dev libopencv-dev libeigen3-dev  libfftw3-dev graphviz

CMake version 2.8 or later 
  CMake is a family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
  Download it at <http://www.cmake.org/>
  CMake-gui is also recommended. 

C++ Boost library 1.55
  Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.
  Download it at <http://www.boost.org/> and make sure it is accessible by 
  your compiler.

OpenCV version 2.4.9 or later
  OpenCV is a open source computer vision library.
  Download it at <http://opencv.org/downloads.html> and follow its instruction to compile and 
  install it such that the it can be accessed by your compiler.
  (To compile OpenCV 2.4.9 in Ubuntu 14.04, 
   refere to http://karytech.blogspot.com/2014/05/opencv-249-on-ubuntu-1404.html)

Eigen version 3.1 or later
  Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors,
  numerical solvers, and related algorithms.
  Download it at <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/> and make sure it is accessible by
  your compiler.
  

Libfftw3f (or libfftw3 if the option RGM_USE_DOUBLE is on)
  A C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in
  one or more dimension, of arbitrary input size, and of both real and complex
  complex data (as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the discrete cosine/sine
  transforms or DCT/DST). 
  

OpenMP
  An API for multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran.
  Found automatically using CMake FIND_PACKAGE(OpenMP).
  Not required, but stronlgy recommended on multi-core systems to take
  advantage of multithreading.
  This is not only a library but also a compiler extension, so refer to your
  compiler documentation for any information.

GraphViz
  Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. 
  Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
  Use to visualize the learned models in RGM.
  Download it at <http://www.graphviz.org/>



                                    BUILDING

It is recommended to build the software in a separate directory. For example

  cd <PATH_TO_RGM>
  mkdir build
  cd build

Then use CMake to generate the necessary Makefiles (set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release or Debug)

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

Then build the software with

  make or make -j 8 (using multithread)

Or, use CMake-gui to do this and use your c++ IDE (e.g., Qt creator) to build the code.

After building, the executalbe "Entry" (release) or "Entryd" (debug) can be found 
in <PATH_TO_BUILD>/bin.

  cd <PATH_TO_BUILD>/bin
  ./Entry <PATH_TO_RGM>/config/config.xml

where you can modify config.xml for your usage
